/*
my next one is gonna be my cabal im gonna make a very restrictive rule of cabal wich would entail me learing some nvigation gui stuff i think
so i need a stack of card items 52 cards ranging from 1-13 with deifferent symbols. i want my rule to be place 4 cards on the field and build only upwards and no changing of anything.
an ace have to be the start of a final field so 8 field 4 playable and one final stack point shuffle 3 cards out at a time can only place and move the one on top.
card stacks can only be moved as a whole onto the same suit.
