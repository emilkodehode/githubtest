// Functions and Methods assignment
// Read the assignment text CAREFULLY

/*
1.

Write a function that takes in a number as a parameter and returns
"Odd" if the number received is an odd number and "Even" if the number
received is even. Use arrow function syntax.

Console log the function call a few times with both even and odd numbers to
show that it's working.
*/

//kept my old one just to have it since that is my submited original answer. redid the function name to better fit with the check first for searchability
const checkOddEven = (number) => (!(number % 2) ? "even" : "odd");
console.log(checkOddEven(2130));
console.log(checkOddEven(2213));
console.log(checkOddEven(5349057));
console.log(checkOddEven(10));
/*
2.

Write a function that takes in a string as a parameter and returns the string in upper
case with an exclamation mark at the end. Use the non-arrow function syntax (function keyword).

Example: console.log(yourFunction("this is cool")) should console log THIS IS COOL!
Console log the function a few times to show that it's working.

}
console.log(stringBangified("i am not screaming"));
console.log(stringBangified(`${userName} where are you`));
console.log(stringBangified("what is happening"));
/*
3.

Write a function that takes in 2 parameters:

 - A name (string)
 - An hour of the day (number)

The function should return:
"Good night (name received)" if the hour received is 0-6
"Good morning (name received)" if the hour received is 6-12
"Good day (name received)" if the hour received is 12-18
"Good evening (name received)" if the hour received is 18-24
"Invalid time" if the hour received is greater than 24

Use whichever function syntax you want.

Example console.log(yourFunction("Gunnar", 19)) should console log Good evening Gunnar
Console log the function a few times to show that it's working.

4.

Use string methods on the text variable to do the following:

 - Remove the whitespace from the beginning and end of the string
 - Split the string into an array where each word is an element

 Console log each method used.

5.

Use array methods to do the following:

 - Remove the first hero of the array (Spider-Man)
 - Replace "Doctor Strange" with "Thanos"
 - Use the splice method to remove Thor and Hulk and add "Captain America"

EXTRA CHALLENGE

This is not mandatory, only for those who want an extra challenge.

Make a function called coolMaker that takes in 1 parameter.

If the parameter received is a string: 
Return the string with "ðŸ˜Ž" added to the beginning and end

If the parameter received is a number:
Double it, convert it to a string and return it with "ðŸ˜Ž" added to the beginning and end.

If the parameter received is a boolean:
If the parameter received is true, return "ðŸ˜ŽYeahðŸ˜Ž". If the parameter received is false, return "ðŸ˜ŽChillðŸ˜Ž"

If the parameter received is any other datatype:
Return "ðŸ˜ŽPrimitive values onlyðŸ˜Ž"

Use arrow function syntax.

Console log the function call with a few different datatypes to show that it's working
*/

/*i started with switch statement and ternary and i got stuck on boolean.
when it was true it printed just true while false printed ðŸ˜ŽChillðŸ˜Ž and i did not understand why false worked and true did not.
when i did it with if it works so im confuzed about that switch issue. but this works im happy. 
i dont see right now how to make it a arrow function.
beside having a starter arrow that checks type and then just send it to another that deals with the arguments and then back with the answer*/
