                <p>
                    Over this year of 2023. I'm gonna learn mainly HTML/CSS, Javascript and more. <br>
                    Let's do this, heres some pointers on what to focus on and learn
                </p>
                <div class="goalslist">
                    <ul>
                        <li >HTML/CSS</li>
                        <li>Javascript</li>
                        <li>Github (source control)</li>
                        <li>figma? design</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    busy work. the goal while learning and mastering and understanding and etc etc. <br>
                    At the end i shall have a site that represents myself. <br>
                    beside the break tag what else should i use to make a given text more readable <br>
                    br only goes so far and is it the best practice to make paragraphs?
                </p>
                <p>
                    when making a container div the size is the sum of all its components. <br>
                    a good way to think and write in css would be starting with width, padding, border, margin. <br>
                    if using the % way of adding width and margin. going over 100% total will make things look wrong.
