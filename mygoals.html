                        Over this year of 2023. I'm gonna learn mainly HTML/CSS, Javascript and more. <br>
                        Let's do this, heres some pointers on what to focus on and learn
                    </p>
                    <div class="goalslist">
                        <ul>
                            <li >HTML/CSS</li>
                            <li>Javascript</li>
                            <li>Github (source control)</li>
                            <li>figma? design</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        busy work. the goal while learning and mastering and understanding and etc etc. <br>
                        At the end i shall have a site that represents myself. <br>
                        beside the break tag what else should i use to make a given text more readable <br>
                        br only goes so far and is it the best practice to make paragraphs?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        when making a container div the size is the sum of all its components. <br>
                        a good way to think and write in css would be starting with width, padding, border, margin. <br>
                        if using the % way of adding width and margin. going over 100% total will make things look wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        more thoughts on this. i need to be consistent in making pages. so i need to follow a way strictly for mysself so i dont get confuzed and others may understand easier. ill use sections as main wrappers for content and set the min width for content. that way if i want some elements to break the flow i can put them betwen sections and they can fill the screen like with the parallax. body should be used to define a base style that will echo/cascade through my site. ill steer away from main in general other than giving body a flexbox so header main and footer is aligned and with main set to fill and body to min-height 100vh i ensure footer is at the bottom of any page. this works so far and if i keep myself consistent i dont see how this can come back around to ruin something but it will probably. ill use header for nav bar. footer for various links to sources if any is used and simple contact info so its always available and such things. 
                    </p>

                        what to focus on. make more javascript. i want my header and footer be made by javascript so i can simply update it one place and it cascades through my site.
