                    <p>
                        im nested inside so i can be controlled an extra level by the textctrl class <br>
                        that is why this text is aligned to the left side. <br>
                        im on the left <br>
                        why all the borders just to help myself visualize what im doing better. :3
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    im part of the geninfo class im aligned centered while above me its aligned left. the geninfo class aligned me. careful with aligning items with % aligned a width of 50% on left and right means 50+50 that is a 100% space occupied and will break. so by using auto or % dont go over 50 and sum of all parts sides margin padding width border. they all add up in some way when elements interact with eachother in the <strong><em>GRAND DESIGN</em></strong> of your site
                </p>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        there was a little video of fancy spinning cube but github said the file was to big. so i should host it on another site or re-render it in a smaller filesize.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="flexcontainer">
                    <p>
                        this text is right outside the flexcontroller. if i was inside i would be affected by the flex. cause flex affects its DIRECT children or the first nest. so i can write like underneath me you can find links to other pages. cause i dont know how to make a proper nav bar yet.

                            thats why im like this. <br>
